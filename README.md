# ethcrawfords-create-app

Webpack configuration based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Changes

- Without React
- Multi static views & one entry

Add new HTML templates to the `src/views/` directory and restart Webpack - all views are automatically considered and styles and scripts links will be injected in them.
